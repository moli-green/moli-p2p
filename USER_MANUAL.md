# The Sovereign Soul's Handbook
> *How to live in the Ephemeral Mesh.*

Welcome to **Moli P2P**. 
This is not a social network. It is not a cloud storage service. It is a digital campfire.

## 1. The Philosophy: Campfire vs. Library

## 1. The Philosophy: Campfire vs. Library

Most apps (Instagram, X, Discord) are like **Libraries**.
You upload a photo, and it is stored on a server forever. It is indexed, analyzed by AI, and sold to advertisers. The "Platform" owns your memory.

Moli P2P is a **Campfire**.
The images you see exist only because someone is currently "holding" them in their browser.
-   **Ephemeral Capacity**: Your browser holds the latest **50 souls**. When new ones arrive, the oldest unpinned ones are extinguished.
-   **Presence is Storage**: The gallery lives only as long as we watch it together.
-   **Digital Natural Selection**: Good content is Pinned and survives. Noise decays.

## 2. Your Identity: "The Soul"

When you open Moli P2P, you are born as a **Sovereign Soul**.
There are no accounts. No passwords. No email required.

-   **Your ID**: A cryptographic key generated instantly in your browser.
-   **Your Avatar**: A unique geometric pattern (Identicon) derived from your key.
-   **Your Vault**: A private space inside your browser where you keep what matters.

If you click the **"ID Reset" (🔥)** button, you die. 
Your history, your identity, and your vault are erased from your device forever. You can be born again as someone new.

## 3. The Rituals (Actions)

### ✨ Broadcast (The Gift)
You don't "upload" to a server. You **broadcast** directly to the people connected right now.
-   It flows from your device to theirs.
-   It is not saved anywhere unless someone chooses to keep it.
-   *Think of it as telling a story around the fire.*

### 📌 Pin (The Resonance)
If you see something beautiful, click **Pin**.
-   This saves a copy to your local **Vault**.
-   You become a "Holder" of that memory.
-   When you return to the campfire later, you automatically re-broadcast your Pinned memories to new people.
-   *You keep the fire burning.*

### 🗑️ Burn / Remove (The Rejection)
If you see something you hate, click **Remove**.
-   This removes the image from **your** view.
-   It adds the content's hash to your local **Blacklist**.
-   **Important**: In Moli P2P, you cannot delete someone else's file from *their* computer. You can only clean *your own* castle. This is "Sovereignty."

## 4. Safety: "My Computer, My Castle"

Moli P2P enforces a strict **Sakoku (Isolation)** policy.

-   **No one can delete your data.** (No specialized moderators)
-   **You cannot delete theirs.** (No censorship tools)
-   **Visual Safety (Blur)**: By default, ALL incoming images are **blurred**. This is your shield. You must click to reveal them. This ensures you only see what you consent to see.

## 5. FAQ

**Q: If I close the tab, does my broadcast disappear?**
A: Yes. Unless someone else has Pinned it. If 10 people Pin it, the image survives as long as *any one of them* is online.

**Q: Can I access my gallery from another device?**
A: No. Your Identity lives in your browser's local storage. There is no cloud to sync with.

**Q: Who can see my images?**
A: Anyone connected to the mesh at the same time as you. Moli P2P is a public space. Do not broadcast secrets.

**Q: Is it safe?**
A: Moli P2P connects you directly to peers. IP addresses are exchanged to make the connection (just like BitTorrent). Use a VPN if anonymity is critical for you.
